<hr style="height: 7px;background-color: black;">

<h2 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; margin-left: 25px;">Introduction</h2>
<p>
    I am Gerald Z. Eborda, currently studying at the University of Mindanao as a BSIT student.
    I am continuing my journey in college while learning not only academic skills but also
    personal growth through my experiences in school and life.
</p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; margin-left: 25px;">Early Life</h2>
<p>
    I was born on August 10, 2006, in Davao City. Growing up, my family experienced both
    simple and challenging times. <br> We were not rich, and there were moments when life felt
    difficult, but we always managed to move forward together.
    <br><br>
    Our family consists of nine members in total. These experiences helped shape my
    understanding of responsibility, patience, and appreciation for what we have.
</p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; margin-left: 25px;">Schooling</h2>
<p>
    My schooling journey has been taken at a slow and steady pace. I prefer enjoying the
    process of learning rather than rushing through it. Taking things easy helps me stay
    motivated and focused on understanding lessons better.
</p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; margin-left: 25px;">School & Beyond</h2>
<p>
    I completed my high school education at Bernardo, where I gained basic academic
    knowledge and life experiences. <br> I am now pursuing my college education at the
    University of Mindanao, continuing to develop my skills in the field of Information Technology.
    <br>
    <br>
    During high school, I was active as an athlete and participated in sports activities.
    Although I am no longer active in athletics today, those experiences helped me develop
    discipline, teamwork, and perseverance.
</p>

<p>
    One of the important milestones in my life was graduating from senior high school.
    It marked the result of years of effort and preparation for higher education.
    <br><br>
    I may not have major events that drew wide attention, but I believe that even simple,
    sometimes embarrassing moments became enjoyable memories that contributed to my growth.
</p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; margin-left: 25px;">Awards & Achievements</h2>

    I graduated with high honors during senior high school. At present, I am striving to

    of college life.
